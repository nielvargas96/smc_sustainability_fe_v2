            <h1>Sustainability Governance Structure</h1>

            <p>To ensure that we have strong oversight and execution of our sustainability agenda, we have put
              in place a robust sustainability governance structure. Our Board of Directors provides overall
              direction and leadership on sustainability. Our President and CEO operationalizes our sustainability
              framework through a dedicated Corporate Sustainability Office. Meanwhile, a Sustainability Working
              Team, composed of sustainability champions across our various business units, is responsible for
              implementing our sustainability strategies and programs throughout our different subsidiaries.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, we will establish a stand-alone Board Sustainability Committee in the Third Quarter
              of 2023 to oversee and provide guidance on the Group’s sustainability strategies and practices. The
              Sustainability Committee will be responsible for reviewing and evaluating the Group’s ESG risks and
              opportunities, as well as ensuring that the Group’s sustainability initiatives align with our long-term
              business strategies. </p>

            <p>Our sustainability governance structure plays a critical role in making sure that San Miguel
              is pursuing a sustainable business model and making a positive impact on society and the
              environment.</p>
